SpreeActiveSaless
=================

Introduction goes here.

Reproduce the undefined method `nested_set_scope' error
-------------------------------------------------------

My store gemfile is attached to help to know what is my runtime environment.
```
Gemfile_store
```

Go to the admin of the store and try to add a new sale.

```shell
http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin/active_sales/new
```
Fill in the fields and submit. You should get the error.


Installation
------------

Add spree_active_saless to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_active_saless'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_active_saless:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_active_saless/factories'
```
